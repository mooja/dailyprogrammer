# Daily Programmer Challenge 65 Easy

# Write a program that given a floating point number, gives the number of
# American dollar coins and bills needed to represent that number (rounded
# to the nearest 1/100, i.e. the nearest penny). For instance, if the float
# is 12.33, the result would be 1 ten-dollar bill, 2 one-dollar bills, 1
# quarter, 1 nickel and 3 pennies.

# For the purposes of this problem, these are the different denominations of
# the currency and their values:

# Penny: 1 cent Nickel: 5 cent Dime: 10 cent Quarter: 25 cent One-dollar
# bill Five-dollar bill Ten-dollar bill Fifty-dollar bill Hundred-dollar
# bill

# Sorry Thomas Jefferson, JFK and Sacagawea, but no two-dollar bills,
# half-dollars or dollar coins!

# Your program can return the result in whatever format it wants, but I
# recommend just returning a list giving the number each coin or bill needed
# to make up the change. So, for instance, 12.33 could return
# [0,0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3] (here the denominations are ordered from most
# valuable, the hundred-dollar bill, to least valuable, the penny)

# 15.01.22
