# Write a program that given a word will find all one-word anagrams for that
# word. So, for instance, if you put in "LEPROUS", it should return
# "PELORUS" and "SPORULE". As a dictionary, use this file, which is a 1.8 mb
# text-file with one word listed on each line, each word listed in
# lower-case. In this problem description, I've used upper-case for all
# words and their anagrams, but that is entirely optional, it's perfectly
# all right to use lower-case if you want to.
# Using your program, find all the one-word anagrams for "TRIANGLE".
